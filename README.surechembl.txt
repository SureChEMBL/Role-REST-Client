The original repo is placed here:
https://github.com/kaare/Role-REST-Client

"deb" branch is made for debianization.
Original debian package description is taken from Debian upstream (no in Ubuntu
Xenial yet):
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-perl/packages/librole-rest-client-perl.git

If you want to merge a newer release into "deb" branch, then look at the
"release-<version>" original tags, not just "v<version>", as these are made by
the author before applying version change in the original code.
